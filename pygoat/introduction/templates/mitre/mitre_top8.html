<div class="box">
  The software constructs a pathname from external input to identify a file or
  directory that is beneath a restricted parent directory, but the pathname is
  not correctly neutralised to prevent it from resolving to a destination
  outside of the restricted directory.
  <br><br>
  A restricted directory is designed to be the location of many file operations.
  Attackers can access files or folders located elsewhere on the system by
  employing special characters like ".." and "/" separators to leave the
  restricted area. The "../" sequence, which is read as the parent directory of
  the present location by the majority of modern operating systems, is one of
  the most prevalent special elements. Relative path traversal is the term used
  to describe this. Absolute pathnames like "/usr/local/bin," which might be
  used to access unexpected files, are similarly covered by path traversal.
  Absolute path traversal is the term used to describe this.
  <br><br>
  In many programming languages, an attacker may be able to extend their assault
  by truncating a generated filename by injecting a null byte (the 0 or NUL).
  For instance, the programme might restrict the attacker to text files by
  appending ".txt" to any pathname, but a null injection could effectively lift
  this restriction.
